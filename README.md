# WiFi-Analyzer
Analyzer 802.11 networks - android app [to refactor]

Note this is my first ever android application. 

It is only educational project, which I created at the beginning of my programming adventure.

Code is very poor and design requaire a big refresh. In the future I would like to take care of this.

Please do not suggest the quality of this app.
